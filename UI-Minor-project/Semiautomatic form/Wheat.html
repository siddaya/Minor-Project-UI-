        <h2>Soil Properties for Wheat Cultivation</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat grows best in loamy or sandy loam soil with good drainage and adequate moisture retention
                capacity.
            </li>
            <li>The soil should have a pH between 6.0 and 7.5.</li>
            <li>The ideal soil depth for wheat cultivation is 30-35 cm.</li>
            <li>The soil should be rich in organic matter to provide essential nutrients to the plants.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cultivation Process</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wheat cultivation begins with seed selection and soil preparation.</li>
            <li>The seeds are sown in rows or broadcasted in the field using seed drills or broadcast seeders.</li>
            <li>The ideal time for sowing wheat is between November and December in India.</li>
            <li>The plants require regular watering and fertilization for optimum growth.</li>
            <li>Wheat is usually harvested in late April or early May.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Properties of Wheat</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheat is a good source of carbohydrates, protein, and fiber.</li>
            <li>It contains important vitamins and minerals, including B vitamins and iron.</li>
            <li>Wheat is used to make a variety of food products, such as bread, pasta, and cereal.</li>
            <li>It is a staple food crop in many parts of the world.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ideal Soil Moisture for Best Production of Wheat</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The ideal soil moisture for wheat cultivation is between 60-80% of field capacity.</li>
            <li>If the soil is too dry, it can cause the plants to wilt and reduce the yield.</li>
            <li>If the soil is too wet, it can lead to waterlogging and damage the roots of the plants.</li>
            <li>Proper irrigation and drainage management are essential for maintaining the ideal soil moisture for
                wheat
                cultivation.</li>
        </ul>
