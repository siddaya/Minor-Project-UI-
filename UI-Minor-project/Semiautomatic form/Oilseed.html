    <h2>Soil Properties for Oilseed Cultivation:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Well-drained soils with good water-holding capacity are required.</li>
        <li>Ideal soil pH level is between 6.0 to 7.5.</li>
        <li>Good nutrient availability and high organic matter content are essential.</li>
        <li>Soil should be free from soil-borne diseases and pests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cultivation Process:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper seedbed preparation is important.</li>
        <li>Planting should be done in the fall or early spring, depending on the climate and desired harvest date.</li>
        <li>Fertilization, pest and disease control, and harvesting are essential steps in the cultivation process.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Properties of Barley:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Barley is a versatile oilseed used for both food and feed purposes.</li>
        <li>It is a rich source of dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</li>
        <li>Barley contains antioxidants beneficial for human health.</li>
        <li>It is a good source of protein for animal feed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ideal Soil Moisture for Best Production of Barley:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Barley requires adequate soil moisture throughout the growing season for best production.</li>
        <li>Excess moisture can lead to disease problems and reduced yields.</li>
        <li>Ideal soil moisture levels for barley production are around 60-70% of field capacity during the vegetative
            stage and 70-80% of field capacity during the reproductive stage.</li>
        <li>Proper irrigation and drainage practices can help maintain the ideal soil moisture levels for barley
            production.</li>
    </ul>
