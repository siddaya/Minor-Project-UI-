    <h2>Soil Properties</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maize can be grown in a wide range of soil types but prefers well-drained, fertile soils with a pH between
            6.0 and 7.5.</li>
        <li>The soil should be rich in organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.</li>
        <li>The soil should have good water-holding capacity and be able to retain moisture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cultivation Process</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maize is usually grown from seeds, which are sown in rows or hills.</li>
        <li>The ideal planting time for maize is when the soil temperature reaches 60°F (15.5°C) or above.</li>
        <li>Maize requires regular watering and weeding during its growth period.</li>
        <li>Maize is usually harvested when the kernels are fully matured and dry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Properties of Maize</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maize is a rich source of carbohydrates, dietary fiber, and protein.</li>
        <li>It also contains vitamins B1, B5, and C, as well as minerals such as iron, magnesium, and phosphorus.</li>
        <li>Maize has a low glycemic index, making it a good choice for people with diabetes or those looking to manage
            blood sugar levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ideal Soil Moisture for best production of Maize</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Maize requires a consistent supply of moisture throughout its growth period.</li>
        <li>The ideal soil moisture content for maize production is between 50% and 70% of field capacity.</li>
        <li>Too much water can lead to waterlogging, which can stunt plant growth and reduce yields.</li>
        <li>Insufficient moisture can lead to wilting and reduced yields.</li>
    </ul>
