    <h2>Soil Properties for Dry Chili Cultivation:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry chili thrives in well-drained soils with good fertility and high organic matter content.</li>
      <li>The soil pH should be between 6.0 and 7.5 for optimum growth.</li>
      <li>The soil should be loose and friable to promote root development and water infiltration.</li>
      <li>Sandy loam soils are ideal for dry chili cultivation.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Cultivation Process for Dry Chili:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry chili is usually grown from seed, which is sown directly in the field.</li>
      <li>The seedlings emerge in about 10-14 days, and transplanting is done when they are 6-8 weeks old.</li>
      <li>The spacing between plants should be around 30-45 cm, depending on the variety and growing conditions.</li>
      <li>Dry chili requires regular irrigation, especially during the flowering and fruiting stages.</li>
      <li>Fertilization is necessary to promote vigorous growth and high yields.</li>
      <li>Pest and disease management is critical to prevent damage to the crop.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Properties of Dry Chili:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry chili contains a compound called capsaicin, which is responsible for its pungency.</li>
      <li>It is a good source of vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and dietary fiber.</li>
      <li>Dry chili has anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties and may help boost metabolism and improve heart health.</li>
      <li>It is commonly used in spicy dishes, sauces, and marinades.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Ideal Soil Moisture for Best Production of Dry Chili:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Dry chili requires consistent moisture throughout the growing season.</li>
      <li>The ideal soil moisture content for dry chili is around 50-75% of field capacity.</li>
      <li>Over-watering or under-watering can lead to poor growth and yield.</li>
      <li>Soil moisture levels should be monitored regularly and irrigation adjusted accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
